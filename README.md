# @piets/homebridge-samsung-tizen
This is a fork of [homebridge-samsung-tizen](https://github.com/tavicu/homebridge-samsung-tizen) plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
It allows you to control your Samsung TV with HomeKit and Siri.

In addition to all the features from upstream this plugin provides a special handling of the TVs volume. Volume is set via a JSON interface to an Arduino.  
Additionally a Lightbulb service acts as a sort of "volume slider".
